Sure! Here's an example of a README file for your Tic Tac Toe game project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Description

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. Players take turns marking X or O in an empty square. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the game board and user interface elements.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the game board and user interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the game logic and user interactions.

## Getting Started

To run the Tic Tac Toe game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/masterAkashBaghel/tic-tac-toe
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Start playing the game! Click on an empty square to place your mark (X or O). The game will automatically switch turns between players.

## Features

- Responsive design: The game is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Win detection: The game automatically detects when a player has won and displays a victory message.
- Draw detection: If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
- Restart option: After the game ends, players have the option to restart and play again.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used to structure the game board and user interface.
- CSS: Used to style the game board and user interface.
- JavaScript: Used to implement the game logic and handle user interactions.
